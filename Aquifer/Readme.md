The committee's purpose is to ensure the efficient operation, stability, and growth of the Osmosis liquidity pool, while fostering sustainable development and expanding liquidity options for the benefit of the network and its participants.

## Committee Membership:

Include the names of the committee members, their roles or positions, and any additional information that helps identify each member's expertise or contribution to the committee.

## Internal Committee Elections:

The Aquifer Committee will follow a structured internal election process to select committee members and ensure a fair and transparent representation of the community. The following guidelines will be followed:

**Nomination Process:** When a committee position becomes available or during scheduled elections, community members will have the opportunity to nominate themselves or others for committee membership. Nominations can be submitted through a designated channel or platform specified by the committee.

**Election Period:** The committee will establish a specific period for conducting elections. This period will allow ample time for nominations, candidate presentations, and community deliberation before the final voting process.

The mechanism will ensure fair representation and equal opportunity for community members to participate in the election process.

**Resignation Protocol:** In the event that a committee member resigns or is unable to fulfill their duties, the committee will follow a predefined protocol to address the vacancy. This may involve the initiation of a by-election or appointment process to fill the vacant position, ensuring the continuity of the committee's operations.


## Responsibilities and Duties:

**Managing the Osmosis LP:** The Aquifer Committee will oversee the management and operations of the Osmosis liquidity pool. This includes monitoring the liquidity pool's performance, ensuring its stability and efficiency, and implementing strategies to optimize its functionality.

**Allocation of Swap Fees:** The committee will have the authority to make decisions regarding the allocation and utilization of swap fees generated within the Osmosis LP. These decisions will consider various factors, such as ecosystem development, community rewards, sustainable growth, and any other relevant considerations for the benefit of the network and its participants.

**Balancing the Osmosis LP:** Ensuring the Osmosis liquidity pool remains balanced is a critical responsibility of the Aquifer Committee. They will continuously assess the composition of assets within the pool, taking into account market conditions, liquidity requirements, and risk management principles. This balance helps to maintain a healthy and efficient trading environment for participants.

**Creation of New LPs:** The committee will oversee the creation of new liquidity pools within the Osmosis network. This involves evaluating proposals for new LPs, considering factors such as token demand, community interest, potential benefits for the network, and alignment with the overall network strategy. The committee's decisions will contribute to expanding the available liquidity options and supporting the growth of the network's ecosystem.

By emphasizing these responsibilities and objectives, the Aquifer Committee will actively contribute to the efficient and sustainable management of the Osmosis LP, ensuring a robust liquidity infrastructure and promoting the network's overall success.

## Decision-Making Process:

**Majority Votes to pass a proposal:** All proposals brought before the committee will be decided by a majority vote. A proposal will be considered approved if it receives more affirmative votes than negative votes from the committee members.

**Proposal Submission Timeline:** Proposals must be submitted to the committee at least 2 weeks before the next committee meeting. For example, if the committee meets on the 15th of the month, proposals must be submitted no later than the 2nd of the month to allow sufficient time for review and consideration by committee members.

**Committee Chair as Tie Breaker:** In the event of a tie vote, the committee chair will act as the tie breaker. The committee chair will cast the deciding vote to reach a resolution.

**Conflict Resolution:** Conflict resolution within the committee will be handled by the Qwoyn Network oversight committee. This separate committee will be responsible for mediating and resolving any conflicts or disputes that may arise during committee deliberations or decision-making processes.

## Meeting Schedule and Communication:

**Meeting Schedule:** The committee will hold regular meetings on the 3rd and 18th of each month at 1800 UTC. This fixed schedule ensures consistent and predictable meeting times for committee members to convene and discuss committee matters.

**Virtual Meeting Platform:** The committee will conduct meetings virtually using Google Meet. This platform will facilitate remote participation and enable effective communication among committee members.

**Meeting Recordings:** All committee meetings will be recorded, and the recordings will be made available to the public. These recordings will be uploaded to the Qwoyn Studios YouTube channel, ensuring transparency and allowing community members to access the meeting proceedings.

**Mandatory Attendance:** It is mandatory for each committee member to attend all scheduled meetings. However, in the event of an emergency, a member may be excused from attendance, and the meeting will be rescheduled to accommodate the member's absence.

**Meeting Notes and Repository:** The committee secretary will be responsible for taking comprehensive notes during meetings. These notes will be posted on the Qwoyn Studios Committees GitHub repository, making them accessible to all stakeholders and ensuring transparency and accountability.

**Public Observation:** Committee meetings will be open to the public, providing an opportunity for community members to observe the proceedings. However, unless a special session is called, public comments will not be entertained during regular meetings. This ensures that the focus remains on the committee's agenda and facilitates efficient decision-making.

## Project Evaluation and Selection Criteria:

The Aquifer Committee will evaluate project proposals for the Osmosis LP based on a set of predefined criteria to ensure alignment with the committee's purpose and the overall goals of the Qwoyn Network. The following criteria will be considered:

**Alignment with Osmosis LP Management:** Assess the extent to which the project proposal supports the responsible management of the Osmosis LP, including the allocation of swap fees, maintenance of a balanced liquidity pool, and facilitation of new LP creation.

**Compliance and Governance:** Ensure that the project proposal adheres to relevant legal and regulatory requirements and aligns with the governance mechanisms and principles of the Qwoyn Network.

## Progress Tracking and Reporting:

The Aquifer Committee will implement a robust system for tracking the progress of approved projects within the Osmosis LP. This section outlines the key components of progress tracking and reporting:

**Milestone-based Progress Tracking:** Approved projects will be divided into significant milestones or stages. The committee will establish clear milestones for each project, allowing for effective tracking of progress and achievement of key objectives.

**Regular Reporting:** Project owners or teams will be required to provide regular updates on their project's progress according to the established milestones. The reporting frequency and format will be determined by the committee, ensuring transparency and accountability.

**Review and Evaluation:** The Aquifer Committee will review the progress reports submitted by project owners or teams. The committee will assess whether milestones are being met, the project is on track, and if any adjustments or support are needed.

**Community Communication:** The committee will communicate project progress to the Qwoyn Network community through designated channels such as official announcements, newsletters, or community forums. This ensures that community members are informed and engaged in the development and milestones achieved within the Osmosis LP projects.

**Adjustments and Support:** If necessary, the committee may provide guidance, support, or recommendations to project owners or teams to help them navigate any challenges, ensure continued progress, and maximize the project's potential impact within the Osmosis LP.

This may include periodic reviews, performance assessments, or specific criteria for continued project support.

## Resource Allocation:

Given the endowment of 250k QWOYN tokens, the Aquifer Committee has determined that it can generate 6500 QWOYN tokens per month through staking. The funds will be allocated in the following manner:

**Restaking:** 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens, equivalent to 3250 tokens per month, will be restaked into the staking pool. Restaking helps to support the growth and security of the network by increasing the staked QWOYN tokens and enhancing network consensus.

**Distribution to Committee Members:** The remaining 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens, also equivalent to 3250 tokens per month, will be shared among the committee members. This distribution recognizes the efforts and contributions of committee members and provides an incentive for their active participation and dedication.

**Discretionary Use of Restaked Amount:** The committee will have the flexibility to determine the use of the restaked QWOYN tokens. They may choose to allocate them towards specific initiatives, community projects, liquidity provisioning, or any other endeavors that align with the committee's purpose and benefit the Qwoyn Network ecosystem.

## Charter Amendments:

The Aquifer Committee recognizes that over time, amendments to the committee charter may be necessary to adapt to the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community. The following process will be followed for charter amendments:

**Proposal and Ratification:** Any proposed amendments to the committee charter must be submitted to the committee for consideration. After thorough review and discussion within the committee, a proposal will be presented to the Qwoyn Network community for ratification.

**General Vote:** Charter amendments will be subjected to a general vote, allowing all community members to participate and express their opinion on the proposed changes. The voting process will be conducted in a transparent and inclusive manner, ensuring equal opportunity for community members to contribute to the decision-making process.

**Archiving of Old Charter:** Once the community has ratified the charter amendments, copies of the previous charter will be archived in the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures a historical record of the committee's evolution and provides transparency and accessibility for reference purposes.

**Display of New Charter:** The updated and ratified charter will be prominently displayed in the Readme.md file of the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures that the latest version of the charter is easily accessible to all community members and stakeholders.

## Charter Review:

To ensure the ongoing effectiveness and alignment of the committee's operations with the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community, the Aquifer Committee will conduct regular charter reviews. The following guidelines will be followed:

**Annual Review:** The committee charter will be subject to an annual review, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and relevant. The review will take place at least once per year, providing an opportunity to assess the charter's effectiveness and make any necessary adjustments.

**Evaluation of Charter Alignment:** During the annual review, the committee will evaluate the charter's alignment with the current goals, objectives, and priorities of the Qwoyn Network. This assessment will ensure that the charter continues to serve as a meaningful framework for the committee's operations.

**Proposal for Charter Amendments:** If any amendments or updates are deemed necessary during the review process, the committee will follow the Charter Amendments section (Section 9) to propose and ratify the changes, involving the community in the decision-making process.

**Community Engagement:** The annual charter review presents an opportunity for community members to provide feedback and suggestions regarding the committee's operations and governance. The committee will actively seek community input and consider it during the review process.
