# Aquifer Committee Bylaws

## Member Participation

- Regular attendance and active participation in committee meetings are essential for the effective functioning of the Aquifer Committee. All committee members are expected to attend meetings and contribute to discussions and decision-making processes.

- If a committee member is unable to attend a scheduled meeting, they should notify the committee chair or secretary in advance, if possible, providing a valid reason for their absence.

- If a committee member misses more than three (3) consecutive meetings or a total of three (3) meetings within a period of three (3) months without providing a valid reason, the committee may initiate a vote to evaluate the member's continued participation in the committee.

- The committee will conduct a fair and transparent evaluation of the member's attendance record, taking into consideration any extenuating circumstances or exceptional situations that may have caused the member's absences.

- The committee will hold a vote to determine whether to retain or remove the member from the committee due to lack of participation. A majority vote will be required to make a decision. The committee member in question shall not participate in the voting process related to their own potential removal.

- If the committee votes to remove a member due to lack of participation, the committee chair or secretary shall notify the member in writing about the decision and provide an explanation for the removal.

- In the event of a member's removal, the committee may follow the predefined protocol outlined in the committee charter (Qwoyn Constitution Section 5, "Resignation Protocol") to address the vacancy and ensure the continuity of the committee's operations.

This bylaw outlines the expectations for member participation and sets a threshold for attendance to ensure active engagement within the Aquifer Committee. It provides a fair process for evaluating and addressing repeated absences to maintain the committee's effectiveness and commitment to its responsibilities.
