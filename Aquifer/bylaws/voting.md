## Voting Policies

1. **Unanimous Vote:** Reserve this policy for critical decisions that require complete alignment and agreement among all committee members. It ensures that decisions of significant importance are thoroughly discussed and considered.

Example use cases:

- Approving major changes to project evaluation criteria
- Adoption or major amendments to the committee's bylaws or charter.
- Allocation of a substantial portion of resources, such as a significant amount of QWOYN tokens.
- Approving significant changes to project evaluation criteria or selection process.
- Expulsion or removal of a committee member.
- Decisions that would significantly alter the direction or strategy of the committee.

2. Majority Vote: This policy is suitable for decisions that don't require unanimous agreement but still need a strong level of consensus to be approved. The proposal will be considered approved if it receives more affirmative votes than negative votes from the committee members.

Example use cases:

- Evaluating and approving project proposals for the Osmosis LP.
- Allocating resources for minor initiatives, such as community engagement campaigns.
- Deciding on routine operational matters, like meeting schedules or communication tools.
- Accepting minutes and agenda items for committee meetings.
- Nominating individuals for temporary roles or responsibilities.
- Evaluating and deciding on administrative matters, such as changes to meeting platforms.
- Allocating resources for minor initiatives
- Determining meeting platform and communication tools

## Applying Voting Policies

Provide guidelines for the committee chair to determine which voting policy will be used for each vote, considering the significance, urgency, and alignment required for the specific proposal.

Example:

The committee chair, in consultation with other committee members, will determine the appropriate voting policy for each proposal. The decision will be based on factors such as the proposal's impact on the Osmosis LP, its alignment with the committee's purpose, and the urgency of the matter at hand. The chosen policy will be communicated to all members before the voting process begins.
