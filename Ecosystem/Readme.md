**Proposal Submission Timeline:** Proposals must be submitted to the committee at least 2 weeks before the next committee meeting. For example, if the committee meets on the 15th of the month, proposals must be submitted no later than the 2nd of the month to allow sufficient time for review and consideration by committee members.

**Public Observation:** Committee meetings will be open to the public, providing an opportunity for community members to observe the proceedings. However, unless a special session is called, public comments will not be entertained during regular meetings. This ensures that the focus remains on the committee's agenda and facilitates efficient decision-making.

## Evaluation and Selection Criteria:

The Ecosystem Committee will evaluate proposals and programs based on predefined criteria to ensure alignment with the committee's purpose and the overall goals of the Qwoyn Network. The following criteria will be considered:

**Alignment with Network Goals:** Evaluate the extent to which proposed programs align with the strategic objectives and mission of the Qwoyn Network. This includes assessing their contribution to the network's long-term vision, values, and ecosystem development.

By applying these evaluation and selection criteria, the Ecosystem Committee will make informed decisions regarding the allocation of community funds and the creation of programs that enhance the Qwoyn Network ecosystem.sing these evaluation criteria, the Relayer Committee aims to select relayers with a proven track record, technical expertise, and a strong commitment to the relaying responsibilities within the Qwoyn Network. This diligent evaluation process will ensure the network's relaying ecosystem operates with reliability, security, and long-term stability.

## Progress Tracking and Reporting:

The Ecosystem Committee will implement a robust system for tracking the progress of approved projects within the Osmosis LP. This section outlines the key components of progress tracking and reporting:

**Milestone-based Progress Tracking:** Approved projects will be divided into significant milestones or stages. The committee will establish clear milestones for each project, allowing for effective tracking of progress and achievement of key objectives.

**Regular Reporting:** Project owners or teams will be required to provide regular updates on their project's progress according to the established milestones. The reporting frequency and format will be determined by the committee, ensuring transparency and accountability.

**Review and Evaluation:** The Aquifer Committee will review the progress reports submitted by project owners or teams. The committee will assess whether milestones are being met, the project is on track, and if any adjustments or support are needed.

**Community Communication:** The committee will communicate project progress to the Qwoyn Network community through designated channels such as official announcements, newsletters, or community forums. This ensures that community members are informed and engaged in the development and milestones achieved within the Osmosis LP projects.

**Adjustments and Support:** If necessary, the committee may provide guidance, support, or recommendations to project owners or teams to help them navigate any challenges, ensure continued progress, and maximize the project's potential impact within the Osmosis LP.

**Transparency and Documentation:** The committee will maintain accurate records and documentation of project progress, updates, and evaluations. These records will be made available to the public to ensure transparency and facilitate community understanding of the projects' advancements.

This may include periodic reviews, performance assessments, or specific criteria for continued project support.

## Resource Allocation:

Given the endowment of 250k QWOYN tokens, the Aquifer Committee has determined that it can generate 6500 QWOYN tokens per month through staking. The funds will be allocated in the following manner:

**Restaking:** 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens, equivalent to 3250 tokens per month, will be restaked into the staking pool. Restaking helps to support the growth and security of the network by increasing the staked QWOYN tokens and enhancing network consensus.

**Distribution to Committee Members:** The remaining 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens, also equivalent to 3250 tokens per month, will be shared among the committee members. This distribution recognizes the efforts and contributions of committee members and provides an incentive for their active participation and dedication.

**Discretionary Use of Restaked Amount:** The committee will have the flexibility to determine the use of the restaked QWOYN tokens. They may choose to allocate them towards specific initiatives, community projects, liquidity provisioning, or any other endeavors that align with the committee's purpose and benefit the Qwoyn Network ecosystem.

## Charter Amendments:

The Ecosystem Committee recognizes that over time, amendments to the committee charter may be necessary to adapt to the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community. The following process will be followed for charter amendments:

**Proposal and Ratification:** Any proposed amendments to the committee charter must be submitted to the committee for consideration. After thorough review and discussion within the committee, a proposal will be presented to the Qwoyn Network community for ratification.

**General Vote:** Charter amendments will be subjected to a general vote, allowing all community members to participate and express their opinion on the proposed changes. The voting process will be conducted in a transparent and inclusive manner, ensuring equal opportunity for community members to contribute to the decision-making process.

**Archiving of Old Charter:** Once the community has ratified the charter amendments, copies of the previous charter will be archived in the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures a historical record of the committee's evolution and provides transparency and accessibility for reference purposes.

**Display of New Charter:** The updated and ratified charter will be prominently displayed in the Readme.md file of the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures that the latest version of the charter is easily accessible to all community members and stakeholders.

**Evaluation of Charter Alignment:** During the annual review, the committee will evaluate the charter's alignment with the current goals, objectives, and priorities of the Qwoyn Network. This assessment will ensure that the charter continues to serve as a meaningful framework for the committee's operations.
