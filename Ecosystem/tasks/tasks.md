# Committee Tasks

Based on the responsibilities of the Ecosystem Committee, here are some tasks that could be performed at different intervals:

### Weekly:

- Community Engagement Monitoring: Regularly monitor community engagement activities, such as social media interactions, forum discussions, and feedback channels. Stay updated on community sentiments and identify areas for improvement or action.
- Collaboration and Partnership Exploration: Actively seek potential collaborations and partnerships with relevant projects, communities, or organizations that align with the ecosystem committee's goals. Initiate discussions and explore opportunities for mutual benefits.

### Twice a Month:

- Committee Meetings: Hold regular meetings to discuss ongoing community engagement initiatives, review progress, and plan future activities.
- Review of Community Events: Evaluate the success and impact of community events, such as meetups, webinars, or workshops, and make adjustments or improvements based on feedback and participant engagement.

### Monthly:

- Zealy Program Management: Manage and oversee the implementation of different Zealy programs within the ecosystem. Ensure these programs incentivize community engagement, promote active participation, and align with the committee's objectives.
- Community Feedback Analysis: Analyze and assess community feedback gathered through various channels to identify trends, suggestions, or concerns. Use this feedback to inform decision-making and improve ecosystem initiatives.

### Quarterly:

- Assessment of Community Growth: Assess the growth and participation of the Qwoyn Network community. Analyze metrics, such as user adoption, community size, and engagement levels, to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies for further expansion.

These tasks provide a general framework for the Ecosystem Committee's regular activities, focusing on community engagement, partnership exploration, and the management of ecosystem programs. The committee actively seeks collaborations, monitors community sentiment, organizes events, manages Zealy programs, and reviews the overall ecosystem strategy to foster a vibrant and thriving ecosystem within the Qwoyn Network.
