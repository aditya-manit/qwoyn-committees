Transparency and Accountability: Consider the project's plan for transparency and accountability, including regular reporting, progress tracking, and community involvement in decision-making processes.

By applying these evaluation and selection criteria, the Community Spend Committee will make informed decisions regarding the allocation of community funds, ensuring responsible resource management and the support of projects that align with the network's goals and benefit the Qwoyn Network community. It is the job of the oversight committee to ensure this is done properly.

## Progress Tracking and Reporting:

The Oversight Committee will implement a robust system for tracking the progress of approved projects. This section outlines the key components of progress tracking and reporting:

Milestone-based Progress Tracking: Approved projects will be divided into significant milestones or stages. The committee will establish clear milestones for each project, allowing for effective tracking of progress and achievement of key objectives. The job of the oversight committee is to oversee all approved projects and take appropriate action if approved projects are not living up to expectations.

Regular Reporting: Project owners or teams will be required to provide regular updates on their project's progress according to the established milestones. The reporting frequency and format will be determined by the finance committee, ensuring transparency and accountability is the job of the finance committee and the oversight committee is responsible for taking action if obligations are not met.

The oversight committee will publish its own report every three months minimum starting September 1st 2023.

Review and Evaluation: The Oversight Committee will review the progress reports submitted by project owners or teams. The oversight committee will assess whether milestones are being met, the project is on track, and if any adjustments or support are needed. The oversight committee reserves the right to intervene with a petition for forced-resignation of committee chairs if milestones are not being met. All petitions for forced resignation must be put up for formal vote and must pass with more YES votes than NO votes. A detailed explanation must also be provided before any action can be taken by the Oversight Committee

It is the responsibility of the oversight committee to make committee meetings available to the public.

Adjustments and Support: If necessary, the Oversight Committee may provide guidance, support, or recommendations to project owners or teams to help them navigate any challenges, ensure continued progress, and maximize the project's potential impact.

Transparency and Documentation: The Oversight Committee will maintain accurate records and documentation of project progress, updates, and evaluations. These records will be made available to the public to ensure transparency and facilitate community understanding of the projects' advancements.

Accountability Measures: The committee will establish accountability measures to ensure project owners or teams fulfill their reporting obligations and make satisfactory progress towards project milestones. This may include periodic reviews, performance assessments, or specific criteria for continued project support. These measures include the right to put proposals up for community vote for a VETO.


## Resource Allocation:

Given the endowment of approx 200k QWOYN tokens, the Oversight Committee has determined that it can generate roughly 6500 QWOYN tokens per month through staking. The funds will be allocated in the following manner:

Restaking: 35% of the generated QWOYN tokens per month will be restaked into the staking pool. Restaking helps to support the growth and security of the network by increasing the staked QWOYN tokens and enhancing network consensus.

Committee Purse:.15% of the generated tokens to be locked into a purse to keep liquid. Any use of these tokens requires unanimous consensus among the oversight committee.

Distribution to Committee Members: The remaining 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens, also equivalent to 3250 tokens per month, will be shared among the committee members. This distribution recognizes the efforts and contributions of committee members and provides an incentive for their active participation and dedication.

Discretionary Use of Restaked Amount: The oversight committee will have the flexibility to determine the use of the restaked QWOYN tokens. They may choose to allocate them towards specific initiatives, community projects, liquidity provisioning, or any other endeavors that align with the committee's purpose and benefit the Qwoyn Network ecosystem. The oversight committee also reserves the right to allocate any amount of the distribution to oversight committee members for other purposes if unanimously agreed on.

Unless unanimously agreed on by the entire Oversight committee, the discretionary tokens shall be mostly restaked (35%) with 15% of the total generated tokens set aside in a purse. Any use of discretionary funds must have unanimous approval by the oversight committee.

## Charter Amendments:

The Oversight Committee recognizes that over time, amendments to the committee charter may be necessary to adapt to the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community. The following process will be followed for charter amendments:

Proposal and Ratification: Any proposed amendments to the committee charter must be submitted to the committee for consideration. After thorough review and discussion within the committee, a proposal will be presented to the Qwoyn Network community for ratification.

General Vote: Charter amendments will be subjected to a general vote, allowing all community members to participate and express their opinion on the proposed changes. The voting process will be conducted in a transparent and inclusive manner, ensuring equal opportunity for community members to contribute to the decision-making process.

Archiving of Old Charter: Once the community has ratified the charter amendments, copies of the previous charter will be archived in the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures a historical record of the committee's evolution and provides transparency and accessibility for reference purposes.

Display of New Charter: The updated and ratified charter will be prominently displayed in the Readme.md file of the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures that the latest version of the charter is easily accessible to all community members and stakeholders.


## Charter Review:

To ensure the ongoing effectiveness and alignment of the committee's operations with the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community, the Oversight Committee will conduct regular charter reviews. These reviews shall happen no less than every six months or if community members propose to have them more often.  The following guidelines will be followed:

Annual Review: The committee charter will be subject to an annual review, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and relevant. The review will take place at least once per year, providing an opportunity to assess the charter's effectiveness and make any necessary adjustments. This will be an extensive review and there will be reviews made every three months

Evaluation of Charter Alignment: During the annual review, the Oversight Committee will evaluate the charter's alignment with the current goals, objectives, and priorities of the Qwoyn Network. This assessment will ensure that the charter continues to serve as a meaningful framework for the committee's operations.

Proposal for Charter Amendments: If any amendments or updates are deemed necessary during the review process, the committee will follow the Charter Amendments section (Section 9) to propose and ratify the changes, involving the community in the decision-making process.

Community Engagement: The annual charter review presents an opportunity for community members to provide feedback and suggestions regarding the committee's operations and governance.
